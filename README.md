College students often have problems planning healthy meals and resort to easy food such as instant ramen or whatever snacks they can find in their cupboard. The Meal Prepperc will create personalized healthy meal plans for users based on any dietary restrictions and the food they have in their fridge and pantry. The user will pick from lists of food ingredients that they have readily available and are allergic to. From there, they can generate meal plans for the week and track the calories of each meal. 

The Meal Prepper™ will be a webpage that users will be able to select from options that are provided  using Javascript such as ingredients and food restrictions. On the home page, there will also be a button that will direct the user to a page about the product and the creators of the Meal Prepper™. With the information provided, the Meal Prepper™ will generate a list of meal options that are displayed in a new window.  

To run the meal prepper server:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
